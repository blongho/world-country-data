# World Country flags, currency and more - an open source android library for getting country flags and other country attributes
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/blongho/world-country-data.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#blongho/world-country-data)

An Android library that contains 'all' the flags of the countries of the world. 
This can be used for android projects where the developer is interested in
getting the flag of a particular country for any reason (e.g for nationality, language, etc)

- A flag is obtained as a drawable resource (int).
- A flag can be set to an ImageView using XML
- There is possibility to get all the countries and their flags by invoking just two methods.

In addition, other country attributes like population, capital, currency, are provided.

## System requirement
- Android minSDKversion = 15
---

## Usage
1. Add JitPack in your respository build file `build.gradle`
```xml
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

2. Get the latest commit from the master branch by including
```xml
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.blongho:world-country-data:master-SNAPSHOT'
}
```
Replace `master-SNAPSHOT` with `vXXX` for the most stable 
version [![](https://jitpack.io/v/blongho/world-country-data.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#blongho/world-country-data) 
or any earlier version from [releases](https://github.com/blongho/world-country-data/releases))


3. Build your project (and make sure gradle has successfully synced)
`Buid >> Clean Project, Build >> Rebuild Projeect`


4. Load all the flags of the world by calling. Do this once in the
    application context.
```java
World.init(getApplication());
```
This inititializes the data. All countries are read, and their flags loaded


5. Get the flag of a country(dynamically)
- You can get the flag of a country by using the two iso alpha2 or
    alpha3 or the country name or the numeric code.

```java
// Demonstrating with Sweden
//The attribute is case-insensitive "se == SE == sE == Se"

// use alpha2
final int flag = World.getFlagOf("se"); // use "se" or "sE" or "SE" or "Se"

// use alpha3
final int flag = World.getFlagOf("swe");

// Use country name
final int flag = World.getFlagOf("sweden");

// use country name
final int flag = World.getFlagOf(752);

// Set the image of an imageView
final ImageView swedishFlag= (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.flagImageView);
swedishFlag.setImageResource(flag);

/*
The value of flag is either
- the flag of the country if it is loaded in the library
OR
- a demo flag of the globe (This provides a fall-back and help your app not crash due to nullPointerException)
*/
```

- You can hard-code the country flag if you know the alpha2 code of the country. 
    Eg. to set the flag of Sweden, you could do

```xml
<ImageView android:id="@+id/flagImageId" 
    android:layout_width="@dimens/imageWidth"
    android:layout_height="@dimens/imageHeight"
    android:src="@drawable/se"/> <!-- Sets this image to the Swedish flag -->
```

- In java code, you could statically do same as

```java
// Set the image of an imageView
final ImageView swedishFlag= (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.flagImageView);
swedishFlag.setImageResource(R.drawable.se);
```

6. Get a Country with attributes like `"id":4,"name":"Afghanistan","alpha2":"af","alpha3":"afg", flag:imageResource"`

```java
final Country afghanistan = World.getCountryFrom("af|afg|afghanistan|4");
// Log.d(TAG, afghanistan.toString()); 
```

7. Get the Currency of this country
```java
final Currency  currency = afghanistan.getCurrency();
@see https://blongho.github.io/world-country-data/doc/ for more 
```

8. Get a list of all the countries with their identifies
```java
final List<Country> countries = World.getAllCountries();
// This list cannot be modified but you can get its contents
```

<details>
<summary><b>Data sources for the project</b></summary>

### All country flags
Most of the flags came from [flagpedia.net](http://flagpedia.net/download).
This site does not contain all the countries in the world so some where downloaded
from [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) after quering the country name

### Countries and their iso alpha values
All country names were download from
[GitHub@stafangabos](https://github.com/stefangabos/world_countries/tree/master/data/en).
These were copied using into the assets directory

### Getting different dimensions of the flags
Some guys from Egypt made some awesome [App icon generator](https://appicon.co/#image-sets)
which generates android drawables as well as iOS images(if you want) in different dimensions.
It is super fast and can do batch processing of images.
