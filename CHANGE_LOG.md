Changes made

1. Changed library package from `countryFlags` to `country_data`.
The latter better conveys the information contained in the library.
The former had only country flags as extra information apart from the
country identifiers. This version and upcoming versions will have more
information about a country.
2. Cleaned code base and improve documentation
The current version have the currency for each country. Subsequent
versions will have more country data

**Mar 5 2019 : v1.0**

This release is provides a more intuitive interface for the user. 

Major changes include:

1. Removal of ability of user to create a country in their app.
In real world, countries are not created like that.

2. To get a country, a user has to know any of the four identifiers of the country

The country name eg Sweden

The country numeric code eg 752

The alpha2 of the country eg "se"

The alpha3 of the country eg "swe"

With these, Sweden can be created alongside its flag using

```java
World.init(getApplicationContext()); 
// you call this just once in your program. It wraps a singleton 
// that initializes everything that the library is to offer
Country sweden = World.getCountryFrom("sweden"|"se"|"swe"|752); 
```
4. To get the flag of a country, the user needs any of the identifiers mensioned in 2 above, then using two methods
```java
World.init(getApplicationContext());
final int swedishFlag = World.getFlagOf("sweden"|"se"|"swe"|752);
```
5. If you are interested in all the countries of the world
```java
World.init(getApplicationContext());
final List<Country> countries = World.getAllCountries(); 
// This list cannot be modified by adding, sorting or removing an element. 
// You can only retrieve information therein
```
NB: All Country identifiers have getters so you can use that to retrieve a Country
from `List<Country> countries`
Give a star to the repository to get updates of new features.
